Tinoco</strong></p><p id=\"isPasted\">Abstract</p><p>Freshwaters transport various types of particulate matter, from plant seeds, fish eggs, and drifting invertebrates, to particles that can be harmful for aquatic biota, such as plastic debris, including macro-, meso-, and microplastics. Common obstacles in freshwater such as branches, logs and hydraulic structures are identified as local hotspots of various types of particles. Hydrodynamic analysis of these locations will provide a more efficient approach to capture and redirect particles in freshwater ecosystems by predicting particle trajectories under different flow conditions.</p><p>In this research, we identify flow characteristics that create hotspots of particles, and study the interaction between flow and particles with various obstacle configurations and particle characteristics in a laboratory setting. The transport mechanisms of particles are analyzed as a function of spacing between neighboring obstacles, submergence ratio and porosity of obstacles, as well as particle diameter and particle density. Laboratory experiments were conducted on a closed-loop racetrack flume, using Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) to track the transport of particles and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to identify specific mean and turbulent conditions that determine particle retention or redirection.</p><p>The study yields 4 main findings: (1) Coherent flow structures are developed at a threshold gap length and at a threshold submergence ratio, beyond which capture of particles within the gap increases. (2) Particles follow coherent eddies to enter the gap, while enhanced turbulence increases particles deviation from mean flow and deter particle entry. (3) Increased particle size and density retards the particle response to flow, creating high particle concentrations at low-velocity regions. (4) Porous obstacles create flow structures across various scales ranging from individual pore size to entire obstacle dimension, with increased pore sizes delaying the onset of recirculation, which affects the location of high particle concentration zones depending on the particle response time.</p><p>Through a comprehensive understanding of flow-particle-obstacle interaction, we expect that our study will offer valuable insights for the efficient management of freshwater ecosystems by: 1) predicting particle accumulation zones, and 2) suggesting effective design of traps to capture specific organisms and particulate matter through assessment of the capture ratio and retention time of particles within gaps between submerged in-stream obstructions.</p>","end":1714107540,"event_type":"in-person","event_url":"","free":true,"grouping":null,"id":"fa4390a2-e0ee-4e6e-9995-8101fc3a5d17","image_url":null,"instructions":null,"location":{"address":null,"building":null,"city":null,"description":"CEEB 2012","floor":null,"full_address":null,"latitude":0,"longitude":0,"name":null,"room":null,"state":null,"zip":null},"name":"PhD Final Defense for Hojung You","online_details":null,"private":false,"published":true,"registration_details":{"external_link":"","label":null,"max_event_capacity":null,"registrants_external_ids":null,"type":"external"},"source":"events_bb","speaker":null,"sponsor":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","start":1714053600,"survey_details":null,"timezone":null}},

These adversaries, powered by advanced network technology, perform large-scale connection tampering attacks seeking to prevent users from accessing specific online content, compromising Internet availability and integrity. In recent years, we have witnessed recurring censorship events affecting Internet users globally, with far-reaching social, financial, and psychological consequences, making them important to study. However, characterizing tampering attacks at the global scale is an extremely challenging problem, given intentionally opaque practices by adversaries, varying tampering mechanisms and policies across networks, evolving environments, sparse ground truth, and safety risks in collecting data.</span></p><p>In this talk, I will describe my research on building empirical methods to characterize connection tampering globally and investigate the network technology enabling tampering. First, I will describe a modular design for the Censored Planet Observatory that enables it to remotely and sustainably measure Internet censorship longitudinally in more than 200 countries. I will introduce time series analysis methods to detect key censorship events in longitudinal Censored Planet data, and reveal global censorship trends. I will also briefly describe methods to detect connection tampering using purely passive network data. Next, I will introduce novel network measurement methods for locating and examining network devices that perform censorship. Finally, I will describe exciting ongoing and future research directions, such as building intelligent measurement platforms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong style=\"font-size: inherit; background-color: transparent;\">Bio:</strong><br>Ram Sundara Raman is a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. Roya Ensafi.

In Daemi’s previous work, it was shown that PFH gave rise to several knot invariants; the strongest of which is a filtered chain complex that recovers odd Khovanov homology. There is also an equivariant aspect of PFH given by the complex conjugation action on the chain complex. In this talk, we will give a brief description of the equivariant PFH (PFH^{eq}). From PFH^{eq}, we will derive a family of knot concordance invariants that are lower bounds of the slice genus of a knot in S^3.

However, direct calculation of such long-term behavior requires solving a system of finitely (or even infinitely) many algebraic equations. In this talk, we introduce chemical reaction network theory, a combinatorial representation of deterministic and stochastic equations that makes it easier to investigate dynamical systems. Interestingly, graph structures can inform the independence of limiting values of variables from system parameters. In addition, we introduce some examples from the Koopman theory, offering a linear representation – not an approximation – of nonlinear dynamics.</p><p><br></p><p>References</p><p>1.

These materials typically employ enthalpy-dominated crosslinking interactions that become more dynamic at elevated temperatures, leading to significant softening. Herein, we will discuss the development of a supramolecular hydrogel platform exploiting dynamic and multivalent interactions between biopolymers and nanoparticles that are strongly entropically driven, providing alternative temperature dependencies than typical for materials of this type. We will discuss the implications of these crosslinking thermodynamics on the observed mechanical properties, demonstrating that tuning the thermodynamics and kinetics of these crosslinking interactions enable broad modulation of the mechanical properties of these materials, including their shear-dependent viscosities, temperature responsiveness, self-healing, and cargo encapsulation and controlled release. These materials exhibit viscous flow under shear stress and rapid recovery of mechanical properties when the applied stress is relaxed, affording facile administration though direct injection or spraying, making then well served for applications in industry and biomedicine. Moreover, the hierarchical construction of these biphasic hydrogels enables innovative approaches to formulation and delivery as a diverse array of compounds over user-defined timeframes ranging from days to months. In one example, we demonstrate that these unique characteristics can be leveraged to generate vaccines exhibiting greatly enhanced magnitude, quality, and durability of immune responses. In another example, we demonstrate that these materials can be leveraged to generate new wildland fire retardant formulations enabling prophylactic treatments of high-risk landscapes for wildfire prevention. Overall, this talk will illustrate our recent efforts exploiting dynamic and multivalent interactions between polymers and nanoparticles to generate hydrogel materials exhibiting properties not previously observed in biomaterials and affording unique opportunities in industry and biomedicine.</p><p><strong>Bio:&nbsp;</strong>Eric received his BS in Chemistry and MS in Polymer Science from California Polytechnic in San Luis Obispo, CA.
